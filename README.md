***Cinquefoil Knot***: also known as Solomon's seal knot or the pentafoil knot. 
One of two knots with crossing number five, the other being the three-twist knot. 
Listed as the 51 knot in the Alexander-Briggs notation, and can also be described as the (5,2)-torus knot. 
Closed version of the double overhand knot.

***Figure 8 Knot***: Also known as Listing's Knot: the unique prime knot with a crossing number of four. 
This makes it the knot with the third-smallest possible crossing number, after the unknot and the trefoil knot.

***Perko Pair***: a pair of entries in classical knot tables that actually represent the same knot.

***Pretzel Link***: a link which consists of a finite number tangles made of two intertwined circular helices.

***Pretzel Knot***: any pretzel link which is also a knot

***Stevedore Knot***: the 61 knot in the Alexanderâ€“Briggs notation

***Torus Knot***: knot that lies on the surface of an unknotted torus in R3

***Trefoil Knot***: simplest example of a nontrivial knot.
